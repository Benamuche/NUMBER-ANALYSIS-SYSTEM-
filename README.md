# NUMBER-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM-
In this project, I intend building a runnable python code that can consider set of numbers from 1 to 117480; within these numbers, ten of it is to be fetched out when request is placed for ten possible predictions. The numbers predicted must be seen as the outcome of a particular system that is dedicated to such game. The system must train the ...
The system must train the previous results inorder to discover the patterns of the prediction.
the idea must be around this system to use different models of data training capabilities inorder to discover the patterns.
the system must have a provisions for previous results input which must be ten numbers out of the original numbers from 1 to 117480.
at the same time, the input data must be done manual while the outcome of the prediction must proceed after the inputation of the previous results.
database of the numbers must be maintained.
